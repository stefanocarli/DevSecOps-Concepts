# DevSecOps-Concepts

## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is a practice that integrates the principles of software development with those of information security and operations, and applies them throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). 

It involves involving security in the development process from the very beginning, and integrating security testing and analysis into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This helps to ensure that security is built into the software from the design phase, rather than being treated as an afterthought.

By promoting a culture of security throughout the organization and delivering secure software faster, DevSecOps aims to reduce the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities.
