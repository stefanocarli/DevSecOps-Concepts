# DAST

## What is DAST

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is a type of security testing that focuses on finding vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs by actively interacting with the application and analyzing its responses. This is in contrast to other types of security testing, such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing), which analyzes the application's codebase without running it.

## How can DAST scans be performed?
DAST can be performed manually by a security analyst, or automated using specialized tools that are designed to crawl and test the application for vulnerabilities. In either case, the goal is to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, so that they can be addressed and fixed before they can be exploited by attackers.

## What are the benefits of DAST?
One of the key benefits of DAST is that it can be integrated into the development and deployment process, allowing security testing to be performed continuously and automatically, as changes are made to the application. This can help prevent security breaches and protect the application and its users from potential attacks.
