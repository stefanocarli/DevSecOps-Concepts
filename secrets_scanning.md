# Secrets Scanning in Secure SDLC
Secrets scanning is a critical component of a secure software development life cycle (SDLC). It involves the detection and management of sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, that are embedded in the source code of an application.

## Why is Secrets Scanning Important?
Secrets scanning is important for several reasons.

* First, the inclusion of sensitive information in source code can create security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. For example, if a password is included in the source code of an application, an attacker who gains access to the code can use that password to gain unauthorized access to the application or its associated resources.

* Second, secrets scanning can help organizations to comply with industry regulations and standards that require the secure handling of sensitive information. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires organizations to protect sensitive authentication data, such as passwords and PINs, and to regularly test their systems for the presence of such data.

## How to Implement Secrets Scanning in the SDLC

To implement secrets scanning in the SDLC, organizations can use tools and techniques that are designed specifically for this purpose. These tools can be integrated into the development process, and can automatically scan the source code of an application for sensitive information.

Some common secrets scanning tools and techniques include:
* Regular expression matching: This involves the use of regular expressions (regex) to search the source code of an application for patterns that match known sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys.
* Keyword matching: This involves the use of a predefined list of keywords, such as "password" and "API key," to search the source code of an application for sensitive information.
* Machine learning: This involves the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze the source code of an application and identify sensitive information. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of source code, and can improve their accuracy over time.

By implementing secrets scanning in the SDLC, organizations can improve the security of their applications and meet industry regulations and standards.
