## SDLC: The software development life cycle

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the process followed when developing software, from the initial planning and design phase through to testing and deployment. It includes a series of steps that ensure that the software is developed in a systematic and organized manner, and that it meets the needs and requirements of the users. The SDLC typically includes the following phases:

* Planning: This phase involves identifying the goals and objectives of the software project, as well as the resources and budget needed to achieve them.

* Analysis: In this phase, the requirements for the software are gathered and analyzed. This includes identifying the needs and expectations of the users, as well as any constraints or limitations that may impact the development process.

* Design: During the design phase, the software architecture and user interface are developed. This includes creating a detailed plan for how the software will be developed and tested.

* Implementation: In this phase, the actual code for the software is written and tested.

* Testing: During the testing phase, the software is put through a series of tests to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as intended.

* Deployment: Once the software has been tested and deemed ready for use, it is deployed and made available to the users.

* Maintenance: After the software has been deployed, it may require ongoing maintenance to fix bugs and make updates or improvements.

## The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC): A Variation of the SDLC that Emphasizes Security

The secure software development life cycle (SSDLC) is a variation of the standard SDLC that emphasizes the importance of security throughout the development process. It involves incorporating security measures and considerations into each phase of the SDLC, from planning and analysis through to testing and deployment.

The goal of the SSDLC is to ensure that the software is developed in a secure manner, with the aim of minimizing the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities.
